# copilot-shortcut
This shortcut opens Windows 10/11 Co-Pilot on the desktop and other locations besides the taskbar.


# Requirements:
- Microsoft Edge bloatware
- Microsoft WebView
- CoPilot working (for Windows Lite, you need to find a way to install it; Ghost SPEDTRE is the best option since it has a toolbox that allows you to enable it!)
- Windows 11 23h2+ 22621.28XX+

# Notices:
If windows dont let you open that url, open the given url as text, save as whatever name u like and use it.
